This is a multiplayer card game that revolves around the idea that you must
build straights that serve as paths to both a win condition and grant access to
new abilities.

Each player begins with their own complete decks of cards that each contain
2 jokers.

Each player begins by searching their deck for an Ace of their choosing
and places it on the table in front of them.  This is the start of their
first path.

The player begins by drawing 3 cards, and building on their path,
or starting a new one.

A path is a straight from A to any number as high as 10,
that has two defining characteristics:

--being in an OPEN state- Where the Ace is a different suit from all the other
cards in its path

-- being in a CLOSED state- Where both the Ace and Top card share a suit, but
that suit is different from all other cards in their path

The Ace, alone, is considered both a closed and open path.
